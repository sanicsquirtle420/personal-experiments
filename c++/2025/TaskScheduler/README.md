# Task Scheduler
This is a simple task manager written in C++. This program uses queues to maintain the order of the 
tasks as they are put in. There are two queues used (priority and regular) to keep the tasks seperated 
based on their importance determined by the user. 

## Features
* Adding tasks (priority or regular)
* Viewing tasks (priority, regular, or all)
* Removing tasks (priority or regular)
