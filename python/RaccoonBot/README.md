# Raccoon Bot
This is a simple Discord bot for me and my friends to use in our Discord server. More can be seen on my [GitHub pages](https://sanicsquirtle420.github.io).

## Functions
- `/hello {name}` : sends back a message to the user with their Discord display name or whatever the user inputs for the `{name}` parameter
- `/overwatch-quotes` : sends a random Overwatch quote from a [.json file](https://github.com/sanicsquirtle420/personal-experiments/blob/main/python/RaccoonBot/overwatch_quotes.json) 
- `/justanothacringe` : sends a random cringe gif from a [.json file](https://github.com/sanicsquirtle420/personal-experiments/blob/main/python/RaccoonBot/cringe_gifs.json)
- `/credits` : Gives credits to me and links my GitHub website
