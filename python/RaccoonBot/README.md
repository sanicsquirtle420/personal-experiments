# Raccoon Bot
This is a simple discord bot that I have created for me and my friends to enjoy. Currently the commands in the bot are
very simple, but hope to add a lot more to it eventually! <br>
Section in my website (https://sanicsquirtle420.github.io) coming soon! (maybe?)

## Functions
- `/hello {name}` : sends back a message to the user with their Discord display name or whatever the user inputs for the `{name}` parameter
- `/overwatch-quotes` : sends a random Overwatch quote from a [.json file](https://github.com/sanicsquirtle420/personal-experiments/blob/main/python/RaccoonBot/overwatch_quotes.json) in this directory
- `/andrew-martin` : Eventually will send random cringe gifs from a .json file, but currently sends a funny :D
- `/credits` : Gives credits to me and links my GitHub website
